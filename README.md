Filled with strange and interesting characters, The Colon Case will be a story-driven murder mystery.  Interrogate potential suspects, search for clues, and follow the evidence to find the true killer in one of the most bizarre crimes of your career.

The Colon Case will be built in C++ using the SFML library.  It will be my first foray using the Tiled map editor.
